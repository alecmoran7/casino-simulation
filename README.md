# Casino Big Game Strategies

This respository will contain programs, data created from said programs, and possibly a GUI application that estimates the probability of winning in blackjack, craps, and roulette based on user input including but not limited to: the amount of money you have, the amount you wager per game, and how big of a virtual sample size to use to simulate the the accuracy of the objective probability of walking away with your target cash amount.

The idea is that anyone can use the program(s) here for generating their own data and take a look at our collection of data to get a big picture look at what the best and worst strategies are based upon raw data that was generated from these programs.
